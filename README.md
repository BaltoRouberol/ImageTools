<h2>ImageTools</h2>
<p>These tiny tools will save you time if you want to resize, watermark or convert to black and white a bunch of pictures.</p> 

<p>If you want these scripts to be installed as proper exec files, use the install.sh script. The commands will then be <b>$ it-resize $ it-grayscale</b> and <b>$ it-watermark</b>.</p>
